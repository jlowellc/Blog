I am going to use this time hunkered down with the family to start a new project. This is going to be written in C# using ASP.NET. It will be a retail store manager. I will have to come up with the user stories, database design, and all that. So, over the coming weeks I will try and implement a new feature every other day. The days in between I am going to alternate with C# topics that will help me study for the Microsoft C# exam. Iâ€™m just going to start at the top and work my way down in the topics as they are presented on the MS test documentation. So here we go.
