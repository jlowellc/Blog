New year, new blog. I have been thinking of creating a blog for awhile now. I am hoping that by creating one that it will keep me on track to accomplishing some goals related to learning as well as building. I've always heard that if you can teach a topic, then you know the topic. As I begin to start taking more complex certification exams, I am sure that being able to write a blog post explaining a topic will ensure that I know the topic. This will hopefully guide me in knowing when I am ready to take the exams.
